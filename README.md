The Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO) is an open-source package of routines and example scripts for coronagraphic focal plane wavefront correction. The goal of FALCO is to provide a free, modular framework for the simulation or testbed operation of several common types of coronagraphs, and the design of coronagraphs that use wavefront control algorithms to shape deformable mirrors (DMs) and masks. FALCO includes routines for pair-wise probing estimation of the complex electric field and Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) control, and we ask the community to contribute other wavefront correction algorithms and optical layouts. FALCO utilizes and builds upon PROPER, an established optical propagation library. The key innovation in FALCO is the rapid computation of the linearized response matrix for each DM, which facilitates re-linearization after each control step for faster DM-integrated coronagraph design and wavefront correction experiments. FALCO is freely available as source code in MATLAB at [github.com/ajeldorado/falco-matlab](github.com/ajeldorado/falco-matlab) and in Python 3 at [github.com/ajeldorado/falco-python](github.com/ajeldorado/falco-python).

Developed by A.J. Riggs at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.
Major contributions and testing were provided by Garreth Ruane, Luis Marchen, Santos (Felipe) Fregoso, Erkin Sidick, Carl Coker, Navtej Saini, and Jorge Llop-Sayson.

# Documentation and Support

FALCO is provided as-is and has no guarantee of performance. Nevertheless, reasonable attempts have been made to debug and troubleshoot the code, and the developers are still using and improving the software.

Documentation on specific usage cases is available at the Github Wiki at https://github.com/ajeldorado/falco-matlab/wiki.

For an overview of FALCO and its uses, refer to the SPIE conference paper ["Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO) I: A software toolbox for rapid coronagraphic design and wavefront correction"](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2313812)


# Matlab Versions and Libraries

FALCO was written using Matlab 2019a and is tested with [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/highcontrast/falco-matlab/_build?view=pipelines) in Matlab 2020a. It may still work on older versions, but functionality is not guaranteed.

No Matlab toolboxes should be required for FALCO. However, the Parallel Computing Toolbox or Distributed Computing Toolbox can be used to parallelize some repetitive calculations by changing the value of a flag, *mp.flagParfor = true;*.

Please email the developer if you find that any other toolboxes are accidentally and/or unnecessarily used or called. FALCO versions of *rms.m* and *sinc.m* have been included since those simple functions otherwise require the Signal Processing Toolbox. Thank you to Jason Kay for reporting the rms issue.

FALCO was written primarily on the MacOS operating system but is also used on Windows and Linux systems. Please report any operating system-related FALCO bugs to the developer.


# Installation Instructions

1) You need a MATLAB license and an install of MATLAB. Multi-wavelength simulations may need a desktop computer or server instead of a laptop to run. Monochromatic and/or lower-resolution trials usually run quickly on a laptop with only a few GB of RAM.

2) Tell MATLAB where FALCO is.
  A) You can temporarily do that by defining the variable `mp.path.falco` in each main script or config file you use, or
  B) Permanently add FALCO to the MATLAB path with the commands `addpath(path/to/falco-matlab); savepath;` where _path/to/falco-matlab_ is the absolute file path on your computer for the PROPER directory. The command `savepath` will keep the directory you included in the *pathdef.m* file that MATLAB uses to look for the functions is expects. Note that the *pathdef.m* file might not be writeable on a server without admin privileges.

3) *No need to download PROPER yourself anymore.* PROPER is now included in FALCO (in the *lib_external* subdirectory) so that it is available for continuous integration tests. Just FYI, the official PROPER source code repository is on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/proper-library/).


4) Try to run the example script file _EXAMPLE_try_running_FALCO.m_ in the subdirectory *main/*. If the example script runs through with no errors, then the file paths are set correctly.

5) Now go ahead and try some of the other example scripts in _falco-matlab/main_, which start with "EXAMPLE_", again adjusting the path definitions for the FALCO if necessary. For this initial functionality test, in the main script you should set the number of subbands and wavelengths to 1 (`mp.Nsbp = 1; mp.Nwpsbp = 1;`) and turn off the parallel computing  flag (`mp.flagParfor = false;`) for it to run quickly. I recommend finding the script closest to your intended purpose and making changes to a copy of that.


# Version History

January 6, 2021: Version 4.0 released. Major changes:
  - Multi-star wavefront sensing and control capabilities added. This required adding the option to have multiple stars in the compact and full models.

February 28, 2018: Version 3.0 released. Version 3 should be the first stable version of FALCO and be supported for some time. Version 3 was re-designed to be expandable for many people's different needs and uses without them having to overwrite each other's features.
  - Wavefront estimation added (pairwise probing with batch process and Kalman filter).
  - propcustom_dm.m added to allow use of different DM actuator influence functions.
  - Config file loaded first in the main script rather than afterward. Makes everything much easier to read and modify.
  - Optical models top-level changed from coronagraph type to layout (i.e., which bench or instrument). This makes FALCO more expandable for different people's uses.
  - Scalar vortex model added from Garreth Ruane.
  - Many changes to syntax and variable names to make code more uniform, simpler, and easier to expand upon.

October 10, 2018:  Version 2.0 released. HLC design code added. Many more features added and syntax changes.

April 11, 2018:    Version 1.0 released. Wavefront control functionality for LC, SPLC, and VC coronagraphs.
